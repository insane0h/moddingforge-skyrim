===================

Static HTML web pages with guides on how to mod Skyrim with the best mods.

View the guide: http://insane0hflex.github.io/moddingforge-skyrim/index.html

Guides last updated: 2015 or so. Updates from now on forwards will be fixing broken links and such. Perhaps I will revisit the guides with some newer mods released in the past couple years (like Ordinator - Perks of Skyrim).

##About

Code (HTML/CSS) was made when I was still learning HTML/CSS/Javascript and the Bootstrap framework during Spring-Summer 2014 or so, so its not the best Bootstrap framework and/or HTML/CSS code and implementation.


##ToDOs:
- Update with Skyrim Remastered updates on 10/28/2016 (well, shortly after, for mod compatibility)
- Update with "Best Mods for Consoles" section/links - or just basic info on like "Search for this mod on Bethesda.net mods" or something
- update with newer released mods - from like 2014+
- enb guide or something
